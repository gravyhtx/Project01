# Project01

This Project was named Mood Swing. The concept for this project was to curate songs according to how you were feeling. Once we determine the mood you're in we will show a list of songs that we recommend to enhance your mood or make you feel a specific way. There are a lot of different applications that we want to eventually work on like adding different themes for different uses.

Our user story began as:

1. AS A User not knowing what I want to listen to
2. I WANT to have a page give me suggestions depending on my mood
3. SO THAT I can enhance my mood or make me feel a specific way.

Our Changelog went as follows:

1. 

Our main responsabilities were shared as follows:

1. Andy Richard - Front-End Design and Song Curation.
2. Robin Aguilar - Back-End Giphy API development and Song Curation.
3. Andres Long - Back-End Openwhyd API development and Soundcloud MediaPlayer API development.
